In this tower defense game, you must defend two towers in different dimensions being attacked by blobby little creatures.

Press SHIFT to warp between dimensions

Press LEFT CLICK to summon a Daisy Tower for 10 mana. These towers deal damage to enemies and generate Mana which can be collected by walking near them

Press RIGHT CLICK to summon a Warp Tower for 20 mana. These towers teleport enemies to the other dimension.


Combine these two to build a defensive network that keeps BOTH homes defended as long as possible. You loose if either home falls.
