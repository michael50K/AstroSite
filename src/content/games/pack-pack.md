Pack Pack
A game about packing a pack


This game is a prototype made for a game jam. The theme was to focus on one single mechanic of a game, and build a concept around it. This game focuses on the mechanic of inventory management in RPGs.

Click to move through dialogue.

Drag and drop items to move them / combine them.

(Items need to be placed in a specific order to be combined)
