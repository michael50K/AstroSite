## Instructions

The centurions are after you! You have vandalized their guard towers with nonsense Latin. See how many steps (passus) you can travel before the guards catch you!

    Type "CURRO" to run (not case sensitive)
    Every 10 passus you stop to write some graffiti (lorem ipsum)
    Try and travel as many passus as possible!
