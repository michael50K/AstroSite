GAME ART BY CALLIE HAMPSON

PROGRAMMING BY TOP BANANA

This game was made for the A Game By Its Cover Jam. Game concept was inspired by https://famicase.com/23/softs/119.html. This is just a prototype and there are only 3 levels made. Have fun!

How to play:

The goal is to get the workers from the entrance elevator to the exit! Blocks are provided in each level to help get them through. Workers will follow your crane, because nobody told them where to go!

[click] to pick up and drop blocks

[space] to send out a worker to start following the crane
