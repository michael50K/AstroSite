# DEMO OUT NOW!

Heroes come from far and wide to find the treasure in the ancient swan crypt. You are the legendary swan who leads adventurers through the dungeon, and with your guidance they will defeat the undead cult and slay the Lich who commands them!


Start with a randomized party and fight in turn-based combat using your party's items to strategize. Optimize your path through the dungeon to unlock powerful item combinations. Defeat the boss and your heroes keep their items from the dungeon to be used in future runs.
