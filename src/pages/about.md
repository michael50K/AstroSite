Iâ€™m a Pittsburgh-based software engineer with a love for developing software that is both functional and fun. 
I love working on projects where I can use my creative skills to create rich user experiences.

I have worked in a variety of fields including data science, full-stack development, game devleopment, and research software.
In terms of my professional experience, I've worked the most with Python and JS, but I like to be a generalist and am open to a broad scope of software work.

Here are some examples of the languages and technologies I've worked with:

| Python | C# | JS/TS | Other Languages |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `sklearn` | .NET | React | C
| `pyspark` | Godot | Vue | C++ 
| `transformers` | Unity | Next.js | Java
| `django` | Monogame/XNA | node backend | GDScript

Outside of work I like to play guitar, work on hobbyist electronics, make and play games. If your interested in collaborating on anything, feel free to reach out!
For that and any other inquires reach out to [EMAIL ON RESUME].
